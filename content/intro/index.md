The Haskell Ecosystem plays host to some amazing projects. Talented developers spend significant amounts of time, often their free time, helping develop, maintain, and support this ecosystem that all Haskell developers use. This space is for any of the developer teams that work on Haskell core infrastructure and power the Haskell Ecosystem

This blog will provide a space for these efforts to communicate with the wider Haskell community. Things you might see here: call for volunteers, project updates, requests for comments/feedback.

Blogs also form a key part of an ecosystem’s documentation. We’d like to take this idea to its conclusion in the Haskell ecosystem and provide a place for this high-value documentation to live and be maintained. In addition to helping out with editing, by hosting the posts here we’ll also have shared responsibility for maintaining the blog posts, helping prevent the all-to-common bit-rot that occurs on blog posts.

There are already a few posts to get the ball rolling. We’re really excited to share these thoughts with you all.
